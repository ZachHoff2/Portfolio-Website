            <h1><i>Project 2: Website Porfolio</i> </h1>
            <p>When I did the Website Portfolio project, I created a website to display all I have learned.
				I created an index that leads me to different pages representing all of my projects. </p>

            <p>To reflect on this project, I learned all about website creation and coding. Beforehand, I knew nearly
				nothing and now I am coding full-on websites. I am very proud of the progress that I have made and 
				the things I have learned. I did well making the actual website and for future projects I can go above 
				and beyond. </p>
