            <h1><i>Project 1: Plan a PC</i> </h1>
            <p>When I did the Plan a PC project, I had to pick out different 
			    components for my dream PC. This project helped me learn the 
			    different type of parts and companies that you can purchase them 
			    from. </p>

            <p>To reflect on this project, I learned how different types of 
                computer parts and where to find them. I felt that I did well 
                following directions and guidelines this project. For future 
                projects, I can improve on making it my own, not boring answers. </p>
